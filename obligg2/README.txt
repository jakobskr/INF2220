READ ME:

The changes i've made from the previous delivery is to add a manpower print in the
simulation of the project, i've made sure the program now works with multiple task with
0 inedges, the realizabilty method now only prints the loop, and earliestStart is now done topologically instead of a dfs.
While i wanted to redo the simulation process aswell, i didn't find the time to do it due to other mandatory assignments.
